# bound_polygons

##SQL Prep Bounder: The bounder gives us ready access to the bounding
box of the polygons, as well its centre-point. Technically, the
bounding box is created with the corners (eg, Bound_North by Bound_East
is the North-East corner), but using bounding longitudinal and
latitudinal lines allows for quicker filtering via basic dataframe
functions, without interpreting a two-dimension coordinate.

Description:

     Add Bounding Box Information to SF Object

Usage:

     bound_polygons(sf_object, geometry_column = "Geometry")
     
Arguments:

sf_object: SF object containing polygons

geometry_column: Name of the geometry column
