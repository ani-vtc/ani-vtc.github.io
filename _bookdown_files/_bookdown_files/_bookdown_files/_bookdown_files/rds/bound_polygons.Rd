\subsection{Bounder}{

The bounder gives us ready access to the bounding box of the polygons, as well its centre-point. Technically, the bounding box is created with the corners (eg, Bound_North by Bound_East is the North-East corner), but using bounding longitudinal and latitudinal lines allows for quicker filtering via basic dataframe functions, without interpreting a two-dimension coordinate.
